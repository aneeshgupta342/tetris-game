<h1>Capstone Project : Tetris Game</h1>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is a game that emulates the original tetris game.</li>
  <li>We made this project completely using only C language and some 3rd party libraries.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This project has all the mechanics of the tetris game. Press spacebar to start the game. Left and Right arrow keys for movements, Up arrow for rotation of Tetrinos, Down arrow for Quick Drop, Space for Hard Drop, P for Pausing the game.</li>
  <li>It does not run the game on a terminal , instead runs it on a separate GUI with appropriate sound effects using SDL library.</li>
  <li>It also has a additional pause feature unlike the original game.</li>
  <li>It also has a level system and keeps track of the score in the current run.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Future Improvements: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>We can update the GUI to be better looking.</li>
  <li>We can improve the sound quality of the sound effects.</li>
  <li>We can store the highscores of different players in a file to keep track of current score and high score</li>
</ul>

<h3> To compile the code, enter "gcc -std=c11 main.c -I"include" -L"lib" -Wall -lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2 -lSDL2_mixer -lSDL2_ttf -o main" in the terminal and run the "main.exe" file.</h3>
